Imbue Network is a decentralised crowdfunding DAO built on top of the polkadot ecosystem. Imbue allows anyone to submit and vote on ideas for funding from a community that believes in them the most.

Imbue brings real-world impact to people's lives, dismantling the common criticism that web 3.0 lacks utility.

By leveraging the power of Polkadot/Substrate Framework on open networks projects founders submit their idea and how much they want to be funded. They then define milestones and split out the total amount between these milestones. E.g 10% on milestone 1, 30% on milestone 2, 40% on milestone 3.....]

Funds are unlocked in the stages defined by milestones in the proposal. The funds are only unlocked after a vote by the original funders is passed thereby protecting funds.

Imbue Network is powered by the $IMBU token that is used primarily for governance, 1 $IMBU token is equivalent to 1 vote and the more someone funds a project the more say they have over the funds being unlocked.

Imbue is decentralised also means anyone can raise concerns and raise votes to return the remainder of the funds if the project has failed for any reason

Additionally, while at launch funding is only done in the $IMBU token, the polkadot ecosystem is the leading blockchain for interoperability meaning funding in different cryptocurrencies, as well as on-ramp for fiat currencies, is relatively simple and transaction costs are a fraction of what they are on Ethereum.

The network takes 3-5% of each successful raise and these funds can be then utilised by what the DAO think is best

Imbue aims to put an end to the rampant scams in the crypto industry. 

Our ethos is you should only get paid on demonstrable progress
